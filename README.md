# Olink
Transforming Olink plasma to serum protein values

## Description of Scripts 
Model_development.R: contains code describing the model building and testing for proteins 

Sensitivity_testing.R: contains code that tests the allowable confidence intervals for transformation factors. This analysis uses an Olink(R) SARS-COV publicly available datast to complete this analysis. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8664884/) 

Validation.R: contains code that validates a subset of the transformation factors generated from the initial cohort. Data from a separate set of samples was generated and the analysis was re-run on that data to compare transformation factors. 

## Data 

Data used within the scripts are found in the Data folder in this repository.
